- âœ… 340 tests passing (100% pass rate maintained!)
- âœ… Coverage: 66.38% (up from 49.98%)
- ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Push to 80% coverage (+13.6% needed)

Add tests for the remaining uncovered areas in lead_pipeline.py to reach 80%
coverage. Focus on _enrich_companies() method and edge cases.

source venv/bin/activate
pytest -m "not e2e" -q  # Should show: 340 passed, 9 skipped
```

PRIORITY TARGETS:
1. _enrich_companies() method (lines 2358-2544) - est. +8-10% coverage
2. Edge cases: circuit breaker paths, notifications, error recovery - est. +3-5%
